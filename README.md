# CYBR GEO

**Procedural CAD, mechanical assemblies and geometry-driven rendering.**

One parametric recipe produces named parts, analytic solids, inspection views, motion, drawings and renderable geometry. Built in Python with CadQuery/OpenCascade, with an in-house C++ photographic path tracer and a separate Mitsuba/OIDN rendering backend.

## Run it

Linux or WSL2, Python **3.11–3.13**. On Ubuntu, install the native tools once:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y g++ cmake ffmpeg libcairo2 libegl1 libgl1 libopengl0 libglib2.0-0
git clone https://github.com/cybrdelic/cybr-geo.git
cd cybr-geo
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements-tested.txt
python -m pip install --no-deps --no-build-isolation -e .
lab preview --step
```

`lab preview` builds an independent flange recipe, checks its geometry, exports a GLB and component list, renders a native 640 × 480 image, reads the exported GLB back and checks the image dimensions. `--step` also exports analytic CAD. Results are in **`outputs/example_flange/preview/`**; `preview.json` is written only after successful completion.

This first run uses the in-house renderer and included geometry. It needs no downloaded reference archive, HDRI or denoiser. Sample count is deliberately modest for iteration.

```bash
lab preview nitinol_fiber_actuator --spp 64
lab preview examples/custom_flange.py --step
lab build nitinol_fiber_actuator --step --stl
lab animate nitinol_fiber_actuator --seconds 6
lab blueprint nitinol_fiber_actuator
```

For the full photographic workflow, `lab render`, `lab video` and `lab film` use V9 by default. That backend uses Mitsuba, OIDN and downloaded CC0 studio assets; see [rendering setup](docs/SHARED_PHOTOGRAPHY.md). Select `--renderer photoreal` for the in-house native tracer or `--renderer pbr` for the raster preview. [More commands and reference preparation](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).

## How it works

| System | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Geometry contract | [`Assembly`, `Part`, `Material`, `View`](src/mechanism_lab/core.py); named components and rigid poses |
| Parametric construction | [CAD helpers](src/mechanism_lab/geometry.py), [advanced geometry](src/mechanism_lab/advanced_geometry.py), [recipes](src/mechanism_lab/models) |
| Reusable pipeline | [Recipe registry and cache](src/mechanism_lab/registry.py), [one-command preview](src/mechanism_lab/preview.py) |
| Native photography | [Thin-lens BVH/GGX/MIS tracer](src/mechanism_lab/native/photoreal.cpp), [Python adapter](src/mechanism_lab/photoreal.py) |
| CAD and interchange | [STEP, STL, GLB and animated glTF](src/mechanism_lab/exporters.py); explicit mm/Z-up → m/Y-up conversion |
| Drawings | [OpenCascade hidden-line projection and vector drawing export](src/mechanism_lab/whiteprint.py) |
| Assembly motion | [Service process and clearance checks](src/mechanism_lab/assembly_process.py) |

Recipes define the object; shared code handles its outputs. Geometry validation runs during recipe creation and its report is retained with the cache. Source, declared recipe dependencies and retained input changes invalidate that cache. The original `cybrgeo` CLI/API remains available alongside `lab`.

## Development

```bash
make test-core       # independent geometry / rendering contracts
make preview         # real CAD → GLB / STEP → native image
make test            # complete suite; see prerequisite notes below
```

[Quickstart CI](.github/workflows/quickstart.yml) exercises the documented install and preview on Python 3.11–3.13. The [complete regression workflow](.github/workflows/recovery-regressions.yml) regenerates the differential inputs before running the full suite. Historical release-output tests can skip when their archives are absent; [test scope and setup](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md#tests) explains the distinction.
